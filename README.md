## About Me

Senior Network Engineer with 20 years of experience working in a large European logistics company operating across multiple countries.

Networking has always been more than just a job for me, it’s a passion. Over the years I’ve been deeply involved in enterprise WAN/LAN, SD-WAN, routing, security, and large-scale infrastructure operations.

Automation has been a game changer in my career. I started 18 years ago with PHP and MikroTik network integrations, building tools to simplify daily operations.   
Today I focus more on Infrastructure as Code and network automation, with Terraform being my latest area of development.

Always exploring ways to make networks more scalable, repeatable, and easier to manage through code.
